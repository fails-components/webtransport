The package provides Webtransport support to node.js.

This package is part of FAILS.
A web-based lecture system developed out of university lectures.

While FAILS as a whole is licensed via GNU Affero GPL version 3.0, this package is licensed under a BSD-style license that can be found in the LICENSE file, while code taken from other projects is still under their respective license (see LICENSE file for details).
This package is licensed more permissive since it can be useful outside of the FAILS environment.

This module started as a C++ node binding to libquiche [https://github.com/google/quiche](https://github.com/google/quiche) (note there is a second library with a similar purpose and the same name), which provides besides other network protocols HTTP/3 support. Now it can also handle Webtransport over HTTP/2 and a WebSocket mapping of the HTTP/2 protocol together with a polyfill and ponyfill for the browsers without reliable WebTransport support or no WebTRansport support at all.
This package currently provides support for WebTransport with an interface similar to the browser side (but not all features implemented), for the server as well as for the client, see `old_test/test.js`, `old_test/testsuite.js`, `old_test/echoclient.js`, `old_test/echoserver.js`  for examples.
Note, that the client implementation only supports certificate checking via `certificateHashes`, however experimental support for rootCA-based checking is introduced with version 1.0.0.
It may be possible in the future to also support normal HTTP/3 with not so much effort, however, there is no intention from the author to implement this since it will not be needed by FAILS. However, PR requests are welcome and will be supported by advice from the author.
The package for the HTTP/3 should be considered as a duct tape-style solution until a bulletproof native support of HTTP/3 and WebTransport is provided by node itself.

## Changes for Version 1.x.x

The interface for version 1.x.x is not changed compared to 0.x.x.
However, it was heavily internally rewritten. 
For example, the implementation does not use a separate event loop for quiche implementation anymore. Instead, it uses node.js native datagram sockets and the event loop of node.js.
So even though not intended, the library may behave unintended differently in detail.

Furthermore, support for WebTransport over http/2 was added, which has to be considered experimental (and the protocol may change anytime), as there is yet no released browser implementation.
Note, that it is only partially implemented and also some http2 features require changes of node.js itself.
Use for the server side either `HttpServer` for http/2 and http/3 support (including WebTransport over WebSocket), Http3Server for http/3 only and Http2Server for http/2 only.
For the client side pass the options `forceReliable`, `requireUnreliable` etc. to force/select a type of transport.

 **Note, that the http/2 webtransport protocol (not supported by any browser yet), requires support for sending and receiving initial a node version with support for receiving customSettings. Versions without support can cause a problem with the initial flow control of the WebTransport streams.  Note, that for sending and receiving the required initial setting you need a very recent version (>=21.6.1 sending >= 21.7.0 receiving) of node.js.** This limitation does not apply to the polyfill/ponyfill and the webtransport over websocket protocol.

 The current proposal for the WebTransport over WebSocket protocol can be found [here] (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-richter-webtransport-websocket/).

### Ponyfill/Polyfill
Together with an experimental http/2 implementation of WebTransport, the underlying http/2 capsule protocol had been mapped to the WebSocket protocol, so that the packages can also be used as a ponyfill/polyfill on the browser side.
Please use `WebTransportPonyfill` for a WebSocket only or `WebTransportPolyfill` as a replacement for `WebTransport`, which automatically falls back to the browser's implementation, if the corresponding features are natively supported in the browser.

The used WebSocket protocol is currently proprietary and described in detail [here](https://martenrichter.github.io/draft-ietf-webtransport-websocket/draft-richter-webtransport-websocket.html). 

## Installation and usage

### Installation

You can install the package directly via npm from node.js or GitHub packages:
In the case of GitHub packages, please add this to your `.npmrc`` file
```
@fails-components:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
```
In this case, you need to be authenticated against Github.

For installation simply run:
```
npm install @fails-components/webtransport
```
this will install the main package for node.js or the ponyfill and polyfill for the browser.
Starting with version 1.0, the binary required for Webtransport for node.js through libquiche is moved to a separate package,
which you need to install manually in addition to this package:
```
npm install @fails-components/webtransport-transport-http3-quiche
```
this allows a faster installation for people only interested in the http2 WebTransport support or the ponyfill/polyfill mapping the http2 protocol to WebSocket. 

The package `webtransport-transport-http3-quiche` provides prebuild binaries for `windows`, `linux` and `macos` for the platform `x64` and `ia32` (only Windows).
Other platforms may be possible via cross-compiling in the GitHub actions, if someone needs this, PRs are welcome.

Of course, you can also build the binary on your system.
If you are running the compiling install as root, you need to use `--`unsafe-perm` as a flag.
Installing the package without prebuild requires a full building environment including clang-9, perl6, python, golang,  `ninja-build, `and `icu``.` See the `Dockerfile` or `Dockerfile.development` for required Debian packages.
This should work for Windows, Linux and Mac OS X.
(You may want to check out the building dependencies (especially for Windows) for BoringSSl, zlib, abseil on their respective websites).

Of course,  PR for patches and for compiling instructions and necessary changes are welcome for all possible environments.

**Warning the build time takes more than 15 minutes, on Windows and Mac even longer! (Due to the building of the third-party libraries).**

In the directory `old_test` you find a simple echo server code. That answers to a series of WebTransport echos. Furthermore some example browser code and finally a unit test of the library including certificate generation.

When testing remember you might need to start a Chromium-based browser with certain flags to accept your http/3 certificate with errors, e.g.:
```
chrome --ignore-certificate-errors-spki-list=FINGERPRINTOFYOURCERTIFICATE --ignore-certificate-errors --v=2 --enable-logging=stderr --origin-to-force-quic-on=192.168.1.50:8080
```
of course, replace the IP and fingerprint of your certificate accordingly. However, the author never got this to work (except for http/2 websocket support, and uses only the `--ignore-certificate-errors` flag) and is using this without flags, but supplies instead a fingerprint when opening a WebTransport session. (PRs welcome).

### Setting up a server
To setup a server use either the class `HttpServer`, `Http3Server` or `Http2Server`.
While `HttpServer` creates a server supporting http/2 and http/3 (so listening for TCP/IP and UDP), `Http3Server` only supports http/3 and  `Http2Server` supports http/2. (Though `HttpServer` is merely a proxy to separate server objects).

For example:
```
const server = new Http3Server({
      port: 0,
      host: '127.0.0.1',
      secret: 'mysecret',
      cert: certificate.cert, // unclear if it is the correct format
      privKey: certificate.private
    })
```
create a new server listening on a random port (port `0` triggers that behavior) on host `127.0.0.1`. The secret is only relevant for http/3 and the underlying QUIC connection, the best is to choose a random value. `cert` and `privKey` are the certificate and private key for the server.

Other but more expert options include:
* `certhttp2` and `privKeyhttp2`: For providing a different certificate for the http/2 as the  http/2 implementation does not support certificate matching by fingerprints.
* `initialStreamFlowControlWindow`, `initialSessionFlowControlWindow`, `streamShouldAutoTuneReceiveWindow`, `sessionShouldAutoTuneReceiveWindow`, `streamFlowControlWindowSizeLimit`, `sessionFlowControlWindowSizeLimit`: As expert's option for tweaking the internal flow control.

The method `setRequestHandler(callback)` sets a callback, that inspects incoming headers and allows to change the incoming path header and also to throw an error if the session should not be opened. This method is considered to be experimental.
In general, the HTTP header is attached as the `header` property to the WebTransport Session object.

The method `updateCert(cert, privKey, http2only)` allows to change the certificate, while the server is running (not supported by all transports).

With the methods `startServer` and `stopServer` the server can be started and stopped.
`address()` gives information about the current server address.

The properties `ready` and `closed` are Promises, that allow you to wait for the Server to be ready or closed.

The method `sessionStream(path, args)` allows to register a `path` to receive WebTransportSessions, it returns a `ReadableStream` of `WebTransportSession` objects.
The args object can be empty, or have the property `noAutoPaths` prevent the creation of new path streams (internal option, do not use in production).
The `WebTransportSession` should behave most like a WebTransport object on the browser according to the spec with few additions and some missing features.

### Using a client
The `WebTransport` object for node or the `WebTransportPonyfill`,  `WebTransportPolyfill` objects for the browser, behave like the `WebTransport` client object for the browser with few additions and some missing features.

As the http/3 package is loaded dynamically and the WebTransport object is created synchronously, you may want to make sure, that the modules are already loaded. You can do so, by waiting for the promise `quicheLoaded` exported by the package.


## Specification divergence

This module implements parts of the [WebTransport spec](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-vvv-webtransport-quic-00) but not all of it.

The types from the [W3C Working Draft](https://www.w3.org/TR/webtransport/) have been added to [lib/dom.ts](https://github.com/fails-components/webtransport/blob/master/lib/dom.ts) but some fields are commented out.

These fields are unimplemented by this module at this time. Some may be implemented in the future, others are legacy fields that may be removed from the spec. PRs are welcome!

They are:

### WebTransport

* [getStats()](https://www.w3.org/TR/webtransport/#dom-webtransport-getstats)
* [reliability](https://www.w3.org/TR/webtransport/#dom-webtransport-reliability)

The WebTransport client only supports certification validation using fingerprints. Without a fingerprint, an experimental implementation for http/3 checks the certificates against the root certificates integrated with node.

### WebTransportDatagramDuplexStream

* [maxDatagramSize](https://www.w3.org/TR/webtransport/#dom-webtransportdatagramduplexstream-maxdatagramsize)
* [incomingMaxAge](https://www.w3.org/TR/webtransport/#dom-webtransportdatagramduplexstream-incomingmaxage)
* [outgoingMaxAge](https://www.w3.org/TR/webtransport/#dom-webtransportdatagramduplexstream-outgoingmaxage)
* [incomingHighWaterMark](https://www.w3.org/TR/webtransport/#dom-webtransportdatagramduplexstream-incominghighwatermark)
* [outgoingHighWaterMark](https://www.w3.org/TR/webtransport/#dom-webtransportdatagramduplexstream-outgoinghighwatermark)

## Development notes

### Test

The unit test suite can be run on both node.js and Chrome to ensure behavior is consistent between the two environments.

[Mocha](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mocha) is used as a test runner in both environments, in the browser it is run via [playwright-test](https://www.npmjs.com/package/playwright-test).

#### Running all tests:

```console
$ npm test
```

#### Running in node

```console
$ npm run test:node
```

#### Running in Chromium

```console
$ npm run test:chrome
```

#### Forward args

Forward args are supported so you can pass any Mocha or playwright-test options after the `--`:

E.g.:

Run only "unidirectional streams" tests:

```console
$ npm run test:node -- --grep '"unidirectional streams"'
```

Disable headless mode to watch tests run in Chromium:

```console
$ npm run test:chromium -- --debug
```

### Logging

This module uses the [debug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug) module for logging.

To enable logging, specify the `DEBUG` environmental variable:

```console
$ DEBUG=webtransport* node my-script.js
// debug output
```

#### Trace logging

To enable detailed output, additionally set the `DEBUG_TRACE` environmental variable:

```console
$ DEBUG=webtransport* DEBUG_TRACE=true node my-script.js
// lots of debug output
```
